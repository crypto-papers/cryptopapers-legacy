#### Description
The authors propose a privacy-focused personal data management platform, which constructed using a combination of blockchain and off-chain  storage.

#### Excerpt
> Personal data, and sensitive data in general, should not be trusted in the hands of third-parties, where they are susceptible to attacks and misuse. Instead, users should own and control their data without compromising security or limiting companies’ and authorities’ ability to provide personalized services. Our platform enables this by combining a blockchain, re-purposed as an access-control moderator, with an off-blockchain storage solution. Users are not required to trust any third-party and are always aware of the data that is being collected about them and how it is used. In addition, the blockchain recognizes the users as the owners of their personal data. Companies, in turn, can focus on utilizing data without being overly concerned about properly securing and compartmentalizing them.
