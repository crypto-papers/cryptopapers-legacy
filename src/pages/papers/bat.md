#### Description
This paper starts with the premise that online advertising is broken and proposes a way to improve the state of affairs for users (through stronger privacy and security, improved relevance and payments for their attention), publishers (through improved revenue, better reporting, and less fraud), and advertisers (through less expensive customer attention, less fraud, and better attribution). The authors propose to accomplish this by providing a more streamlined and secure browser environment where transactions are managed by Brave's Zero Knowledge Proof ledger and monetized using the Basic Attention Token (BAT).

#### Excerpt
> Brave will now introduce BAT (Basic Attention Token), a token for a decentralized ad exchange. It compensates the browser user for attention while protecting privacy. BAT connects advertisers, publishers, and users and is denominated by relevant user attention, while removing social and economic costs associated with existing ad networks, e.g., fraud, privacy violations, and malvertising. BAT is a payment system that rewards and protects the user while giving better conversion to advertisers and higher yield to publishers. We see BAT and associated technologies as a future part of web standards, solving the important problem of monetizing publisher content while protecting user privacy.
