#### Excerpt
> Neutron Cryptocurrecny (NTRN) is a maturing, dependable, blockchain that features Proof of Stake and a Nucleus Node System. Speed and very low transaction fees are among Neutron's strong points. Neutron has been running since 2015 but had a bit of a rough start. Since then the project has gained a new dedicated team and has come a very long way in every aspect from Development to Community.
