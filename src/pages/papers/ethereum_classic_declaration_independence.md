#### Excerpt
> Let it be known to the entire world that on July 20th, 2016, at block 1,920,000, we as a community of sovereign
individuals stood united by a common vision to continue the original Ethereum blockchain that is truly free from
censorship, fraud or third party interference. In realizing that the blockchain represents absolute truth, we stand
by it, supporting its immutability and its future. We do not make this declaration lightly, nor without forethought to
the consequences of our actions.
