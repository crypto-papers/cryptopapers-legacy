#### Description
This paper outline the federated Byzantine agreement (FBA) model for consensus by which participants in the network only accept a transaction as valid if the majority of the contacts it considers important also agree to the transaction. The paper goes on to explain optimal resilience and federated voting withing the FBA model. Finally, it describes the application of these prinicples to the Stellar Consensus Protocol.

#### Excerpt
> This paper introduces a new model for consensus called federated Byzantine agreement (FBA). FBA achieves robustness through quorum slices—individual trust decisions made by each node that together determine system-level quorums. Slices bind the system together much the way individual networks’ peering and transit decisions now unify the Internet. We also present the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a construction for FBA. Like all Byzantine agreement protocols, SCP makes no assumptions about the rational behavior of attackers. Unlike prior Byzantine agreement models, which presuppose a unanimously accepted membership list, SCP enjoys open membership that promotes organic network growth. Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stake schemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements, lowering the barrier to entry and potentially opening up financial systems to new participants.
