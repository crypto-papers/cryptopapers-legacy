#### Excerpt
> Current online video game trading of virtual assets for Online Games and other online gaming types is approximately $50 billion. OPSkins, the world’s largest video game virtual goods trading marketplace with millions of registered buyers and sellers, is developing WAX to expand virtual asset trading. As Amazon is to physical goods, OPSkins is to virtual goods. Amazon built the “Amazon Marketplace” allowing millions of entrepreneurs to open up their own trading virtual store. Similarly, OPskins is building a decentralized “WAX Platform” allowing millions of traders to create their own virtual store, starting with thousands of gaming sites today in the virtual goods ecosystem. With WAX, millions of individuals can create new businesses based on their passion for video games offering buy, sell, rent, or trade capabilities to their social networks, extending the market far beyond what it is today.
