#### Excerpt
> KPR Medical Solutions will provide the two main product categories of the cryptocurrency ‘KPR Coin’ and the produce and supply of medicinal marijuana in Australia. The KPR Coin’s launch as a cryptocurrency is to be available for purchase in exchange for Ethereum. There will be no pre-mining of Coins by the founders and available Coins will cap at 100,000,000 total. The funds raised will be used to commence the medical solutions product. The locally produced product will source power from our new, self-installed renewable energy sources. We intend to strive for both the business and community’s long-term sustainability.
