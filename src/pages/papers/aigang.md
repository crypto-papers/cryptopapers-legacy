#### Excerpt
> We at Aigang believe that the future of insurance will be defined by blockchain and crypto technologies, helping create new digital insurance services geared for mobile and digital world. The emergence of IoT industry and growth of smart devices will unlock a potential for insurance services, and unlocking crowd-sourced intelligence which can help understand the data and apply new algorithms for risk and pricing, and thus can offer convenient and easy to manage insurance products. This can be achieved only by using decentralized blockchain platform, as basis for creating insurance protocol, which can embed in any device in the world.
