[![Cover of an Ontology for Smart Contracts](/covers/ontology_for_smart_contracts.png)](/pdf/ontology_for_smart_contracts.pdf)

by Darryl McAdams

#### Description
This paper presents an ontology (collection of concepts) that attempts to outline the essential features of many smart contracts. The paper begins with a general overview of the proposed ontology, gives analyses of a number of interesting smart contracts, and proposes certain ontologies that a well-designed blockchain should be able to support.

#### Excerpt
> In the context of smart contracts, a number of concepts arise over and over, which constitute this domainâ€™s ontology. This paper assumes that smart contracts fundamentally are stateful computations consisting of some state value which changes over time, and a fixed, unchanging transition function. Precisely what constitutes a state, and how many states there are, is entirely dependent on the smart contract, and might be as simple as a token representing a state in a finite state machine (e.g. q3) or it might be some richer piece of symbolic data.
