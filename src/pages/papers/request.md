#### Description
The paper opens with an overview of the Request Ledger and the three layers of the Request ecosytem. These layers include the core layer, which manages the network consensus, the extensions layer wherein most payments will occur, and the applications layer built on top of the blockchain. The paper then covers potential use cases including B2B invoicing, online payments, job automation, business logic and trade laws, simplification of commercial tools, transparency of institutions, and IoT and smart contracts. There is also a section covering the Request token, and ERC20 token created for use on the Request Network. The authors close with draft project roadmap, team overview, and some considerations regarding the technical architecture.

#### Excerpt
> Request is a decentralized network that allows anyone to request a payment (a Request Invoice) for which the recipient can pay in a secure way. All of the information is stored in a decentralized authentic ledger. This results in cheaper, easier, and more secure payments, and it allows for a wide range of automation possibilities.
