#### Excerpt
> CanYa is the ultimate link between cryptocurrency and the real world. The ERC20-based token is backed by the value of skilled human services with an estimated value of $2tn globally. The token can be exchanged in the platform and converted to real world skilled labour. A freemium subscription model provides a constant demand for the token and a revenue stream for the platform. By integrating fiat payment gateways, CanYaCoin aims to become a legitimate gateway of fiat into crypto, enhancing the entire ecosystem and accelerating mainstream adoption.
