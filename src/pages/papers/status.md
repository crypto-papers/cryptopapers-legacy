#### Description
This paper describes the state of most current social networks, which address the needs of three distinct parties, namely the platform owner, the advertiser, and the user. In this model the balance of power lies with the platform owner. The authors then propose a flatter model wherein users are stakeholders in the platform and incentivized accordingly. The authors then outline the proposed features and governance of the Status Network. Finally, the paper also provides information on the SNT token launch, SNT allocation, and project budget.

#### Excerpt
> The Status Network token is a modular utility token that fuels the Status network. This includes a Decentralized Push Notification Market, Governance of the Status client, Community Curation of content, along with social communication tools such as Tribute to Talk. We also propose a fiat-to-crypto 'Teller Network', DApp Directory, Sticker Market, and demonstrate our research on a User Acquisition Engine to grow the Network.
