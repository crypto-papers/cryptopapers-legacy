#### Description
This paper discusses the technical implementation of the Kin Rewards Engine, which will use cryptographic tokens to create economic incentives for participants to integrate into the Kin ecosystem. The paper explains the algorithm used to determine rewards as well as potential vulnerabilities of the model.

#### Excerpt
> The goal of the Kin Rewards Engine is to economically align a large group of developers to work together to build an alternative ecosystem of digital services â€“ an ecosystem that is both compelling and open. To achieve this goal, a simple yet non-gameable rewards algorithm is needed. Developing this algorithm will take time and will require a safe and iterative approach.
