#### Description
The paper outlines several pain-points in the technology market today. Namely, that devices are insecure, using cryptocurrencies is difficult, it is difficult to monetize and secure p2p markets, and there is lack of a fair and decentralized app store. It describes the proposed solution to these problems - the SOLARIN phone and the Sirin blockchain upon which it will run. The paper also provides a marketing plan, a roadmap, and details about the token system and crowdsale.
