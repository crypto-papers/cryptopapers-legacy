#### Excerpt
> In character, Kin is a pure cryptocurrency of fixed supply. It is fractionally divisible and long-term non-inflationary. However, as described below, only a small portion of the Kin supply will become liquid in the near future, as most of the Kin supply is reserved for the Kin Rewards Engine.
